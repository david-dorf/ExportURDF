# OnShape URDF Exporter [WIP]

This package is a tool to export URDF files from OnShape assemblies. It is inspired by the onshape-to-robot library, which is a Python library that allows to export URDF files from OnShape assemblies.

## Purpose
The onshape-to-robot library is a great tool, but has notable bugs that have gone unaddressed for a long time. This project aims to address those bugs and serve as a more maintainable community effort as part of the unified URDF converter library.

## Roadmap
1. Add pristine support for exporting URDF files from OnShape assemblies.
2. Add joint limits.
3. Add material support.
4. Get orientation of parts and joint origins correctly to match OnShape.
4. Implement a more robust testing suite.
