# OnShape URDF Exporter [WIP]

This package is a tool to export URDF files from OnShape assemblies. It is inspired by the onshape-to-robot library, which is a Python library that allows to export URDF files from OnShape assemblies.

## Purpose
The onshape-to-robot library is a great tool, but has notable bugs that have gone unaddressed for a long time. This project aims to address those bugs and serve as a more maintainable community effort as part of the unified URDF converter library.

## Roadmap
1. Begin development of the OnShape URDF exporter, starting with basic functionality based on the onshape-to-robot library.
2. Add mesh export functionality for visual and collision meshes.
3. Test all mate types and configurations to ensure compatibility.
