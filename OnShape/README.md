# OnShape URDF Exporter [WIP]

This package is a tool to export URDF files from OnShape assemblies. It is inspired by the onshape-to-robot library, which is a Python library that allows to export URDF files from OnShape assemblies.

## Purpose
The onshape-to-robot library is a great tool, but has notable bugs that have gone unaddressed for a long time. This project aims to address those bugs and serve as a more maintainable community effort as part of the unified URDF converter library.

## Roadmap
1. Test out the script on different OnShape assemblies to identify and fix any issues.
2. Add joint limits. The API is pretty messy for retrieving joint limits it seems.
3. Implement unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and maintainability.
