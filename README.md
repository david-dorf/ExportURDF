# ExportURDF
ExportURDF is a unified URDF converter library for CAD programs, primarily targeting Fusion360, OnShape, and Solidworks. The library aims to provide central, maintainable location for scripts to convert CAD models to URDF files, which are commonly used in robotics and simulation.

## Supported CAD Programs

Currently, this library primarily supports Fusion360 and OnShape. Solidworks 2018-2021 support is provided by https://github.com/ros/solidworks_urdf_exporter

## Getting Started

To get started with the library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/daviddorf2023/ExportURDF.git`
2. Follow the instructions in the respective directories for Fusion360 and OnShape to install the required dependencies and run the converter scripts.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Up to date Solidworks support and test cases will always be helpful.
