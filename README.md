# Unified URDF Converter Library

This is a unified URDF converter library for CAD programs, primarily targeting Fusion360, OnShape, and Solidworks. The library aims to provide a seamless conversion process from CAD models to URDF files, which are commonly used in robotics.

## Supported CAD Programs

Currently, the library supports Fusion360 and OnShape as the two functional CAD programs. However, work is still in progress to add support for SolidWorks and other CAD programs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/daviddorf2023/ExportURDF.git`
2. Follow the instructions in the respective directories for Fusion360 and OnShape to install the required dependencies and run the converter scripts.
