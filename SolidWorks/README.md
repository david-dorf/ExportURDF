# SolidWorks URDF Converter

This repository serves as a placeholder for a SolidWorks URDF converter. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool that can convert SolidWorks models into URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files, which are commonly used in robotics simulations and applications. The most recent version of a similar tool is the [\[SolidWorks to URDF Exporter\]](https://github.com/ros/solidworks_urdf_exporter), which isn't maintained anymore (last update was for SolidWorks 2021). For now, that tool is used as a base for SolidWorks URDF functionality and is included in this repository.

## Roadmap
1. Start developing the SolidWorks URDF converter for the latest version of SolidWorks (2024). Possibly extend support for older versions.
2. Add full support for exporting SolidWorks models to URDF files.
3. Export visual and collision meshes for the URDF files.
4. Add additional features such as materials integration and SDF tools integration.
5. Fix any lingering issues with the converter tool.
